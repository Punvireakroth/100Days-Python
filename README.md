So what is object

- Let say you run a resturant and you do it alone without staff thus you have to be a waiter, a cleaner, a chef and so on. By doing that we can't run a big resturant but what if we hire chef , waiter , cleaner so they know what they're doing so this is object but you can't hire just one waiter thus it can be vireak_waiter , vireak_roth_waiter and so on thus waiter alone is call class and vireak_waiter and vireak_roth_waiter is called object and in one object it consist of attribute and method.

this is how we get the object

```python
vireak = Car()
```

this how we get attribute

```python
Car.speed
```
